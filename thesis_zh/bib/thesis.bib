  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) and variational methods were introduced into image processing about fifteen years ago. Since then, intensive research has been carried out. The goals of this book are to present a variety of image analysis applications, the precise mathematics involved and how to discretize them. Thus, this book is intended for two audiences. The first is the mathematical community by showing the contribution of mathematics to this domain. It is also the occasion to highlight some unsolved theoretical questions. The second is the computer vision community by presenting a clear, self-contained and global overview of the mathematics involved in image processing problems. This work will serve as a useful source of reference and inspiration for fellow researchers in Applied Mathematics and Computer Vision, as well as being a basis for advanced courses within these fields. During the four years since the publication of the first edition, there has been substantial progress in the range of image processing applications covered by the PDE framework. The main goals of the second edition are to update the first edition by giving a coherent account of some of the recent challenging applications, and to update the existing material. In addition, this book provides the reader with the opportunity to make his own simulations with a minimal effort. To this end, programming tools are made available, which will allow the reader to implement and test easily some classical approaches. Reviews of the earlier edition: "Mathematical Problems in Image Processing is a major, elegant, and unique contribution to the applied mathematics literature, oriented toward applications in image processing and computer vision.... Researchers and practitioners working in the field will benefit by adding this book to their personal collection. Students and instructors will benefit by using this book as a graduate course textbook." -- SIAM Review "The Mathematician -- and he doesn't need to be a 'die-hard' applied mathematician -- will love it because there are all these spectacular applications of nontrivial mathematical techniques and he can even find some open theoretical questions. The numerical analyst will discover many challenging problems and implementations. The image processor will be an eager reader because the book provides all the mathematical elements, including most of the proofs.... Both content and typography are a delight. I can recommend the book warmly for theoretical and applied researchers." -- Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematics},

Furthermore, it is shown that the limit solution as the power solves the problem of Bean's model in the type-II superconductivity theory.

Attention then switches to the global attractor, a finite-dimensional subset of the infinite-dimensional phase space which determines the asymptotic dynamics. In particular, the concluding chapters investigate in what sense the dynamics restricted to the attractor are themselves "finite-dimensional." The book is intended as a didactic text for first year graduates, and assumes only a basic knowledge of Banach and Hilbert spaces, and a working understanding of the Lebesgue integral.},

Estimating the rate of decay for the energy requires a sub-criticality condition. The method covers the case of solutions which are not compactly supported or which have compact support. In the last case, we show that the size of the support increases with the number of nodes.},

The operators are not necessarily in divergence form, have terms of lower order, and have low regularity assumptions on the coefficients. The needed weighted Sobolev spaces are, in general, anisotropic spaces defined by a non-negative continuous matrix weight. As preparation, we prove a Poincaré inequality with respect to such matrix weights and analyze the elementary properties of the weighted spaces. Comparisons to known results and examples of operators which are elliptic away from a hyperplane of arbitrary codimension are given. Finally, in the important special case of operators whose principal part is of Grushin type, we apply these results to obtain some spectral theory results such as the existence of a principal eigenvalue.},

The corresponding class of initial and boundary value problems has already been studied previously, proving well-posedness of weak solutions and the existence of the global attractor, assuming that the nonlinearities are subcritical to a given exponent. The goal of this article is to show that the previous analysis can be redone for supercritical nonlinearities by proving an additional L∞-estimate on the solutions. In particular, we derive new conditions which reflect an exact balance between the internal and the boundary mechanisms involved, even when both the nonlinear sources contribute in opposite directions. Then, we show how to construct a trajectory attractor for the weak solutions of the associated parabolic system, and prove that any solution belonging to the attractor is bounded, which implies uniqueness. Finally, we also prove for the (semilinear) reaction–diffusion equation with nonlinear dynamic boundary conditions, that the fractal dimension of the global attractor is of the order ν−(N−1), as diffusion ν→0+, in any space dimension N⩾2, improving some recent results in Gal (2012) [23].},

  abstract = {The third of three volumes on partial differential equations, this is devoted to nonlinear PDE. It treats a number of equations of classical continuum mechanics, including relativistic versions, as well as various equations arising in differential geometry, such as in the study of minimal surfaces, isometric imbedding, conformal deformation, harmonic maps, and prescribed Gauss curvature. In addition, some nonlinear diffusion problems are studied. It also introduces such analytical tools as the theory of L\^p Sobolev spaces, Holder spaces, Hardy spaces, and Morrey spaces, and also a development of Calderon-Zygmund theory and paradifferential operator calculus. The book is targeted at graduate students in mathematics and at professional mathematicians with an interest in partial differential equations, mathematical physics, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and complex analysis. In this second edition, there are seven new sections including Sobolev spaces on rough domains, boundary layer phenomena for the heat equation, an extension of complex interpolation theory, and Navier-Stokes equations with small viscosity. In addition, several other sections have been substantially rewritten, and numerous others polished to reflect insights obtained through the use of these books over time. Michael E. Taylor is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. Review of first edition: ``These volumes will be read by several generations of readers eager to learn the modern theory of partial differential equations of mathematical physics and the analysis in which this theory is rooted.''(SIAM Review, June 1998)},

Many problems in mechanics, geometry, and probability lead to such equations when formulated in mathematical terms. Yet despite a long history of contributions, no core theory has been formulated. Written by the winner of the 1994 Fields Medal, this outstanding two-volume work helps shed new light on this important topic. Volume 1 emphasizes the mathematical analysis of incompressible models. After recalling the fundamental description of Newtonian fluids, a profound and self-contained study of both the classical Navier-Stokes equations (including the inhomogeneous case) and the Euler equations is given. Results about the existence and regularity of solutions are presented with complete proofs. The text highlights in particular the use of modern analytical tools and methods, and it indicates many open problems. Mathematical Topics in Fluid Mechanics will be an indispensable reference for every researcher in the field. Its topicality and the clear, concise presentations by the author make it an outstanding contribution to the great theoretical problems concerning mathematical modelling of physical phenomena.},
