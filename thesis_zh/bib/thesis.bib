  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) and variational methods were introduced into image processing about fifteen years ago. Since then, intensive research has been carried out. The goals of this book are to present a variety of image analysis applications, the precise mathematics involved and how to discretize them. Thus, this book is intended for two audiences. The first is the mathematical community by showing the contribution of mathematics to this domain. It is also the occasion to highlight some unsolved theoretical questions. The second is the computer vision community by presenting a clear, self-contained and global overview of the mathematics involved in image processing problems. This work will serve as a useful source of reference and inspiration for fellow researchers in Applied Mathematics and Computer Vision, as well as being a basis for advanced courses within these fields. During the four years since the publication of the first edition, there has been substantial progress in the range of image processing applications covered by the PDE framework. The main goals of the second edition are to update the first edition by giving a coherent account of some of the recent challenging applications, and to update the existing material. In addition, this book provides the reader with the opportunity to make his own simulations with a minimal effort. To this end, programming tools are made available, which will allow the reader to implement and test easily some classical approaches. Reviews of the earlier edition: "Mathematical Problems in Image Processing is a major, elegant, and unique contribution to the applied mathematics literature, oriented toward applications in image processing and computer vision.... Researchers and practitioners working in the field will benefit by adding this book to their personal collection. Students and instructors will benefit by using this book as a graduate course textbook." -- SIAM Review "The Mathematician -- and he doesn't need to be a 'die-hard' applied mathematician -- will love it because there are all these spectacular applications of nontrivial mathematical techniques and he can even find some open theoretical questions. The numerical analyst will discover many challenging problems and implementations. The image processor will be an eager reader because the book provides all the mathematical elements, including most of the proofs.... Both content and typography are a delight. I can recommend the book warmly for theoretical and applied researchers." -- Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematics},

The existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to the system are established. Furthermore, it is shown that the limit solution as the power solves the problem of Bean's model in the type-II superconductivity theory. The result provides us information about how the superconductor material under the external force becomes the normal conductor and vice versa. It also provides an effective method for finding numerical solutions to Bean's model.},

Attention then switches to the global attractor, a finite-dimensional subset of the infinite-dimensional phase space which determines the asymptotic dynamics. In particular, the concluding chapters investigate in what sense the dynamics restricted to the attractor are themselves "finite-dimensional." The book is intended as a didactic text for first year graduates, and assumes only a basic knowledge of Banach and Hilbert spaces, and a working understanding of the Lebesgue integral.},

By a shooting method we prove the existence of solutions with any prescribed number of nodes. The method is based on a change of variables in the phase plane, a very general computation of an angular velocity and new estimates for the decay of an energy associated with an asymptotic Hamiltonian problem. Estimating the rate of decay for the energy requires a sub-criticality condition. The method covers the case of solutions which are not compactly supported or which have compact support. In the last case, we show that the size of the support increases with the number of nodes.},

The operators are not necessarily in divergence form, have terms of lower order, and have low regularity assumptions on the coefficients. The needed weighted Sobolev spaces are, in general, anisotropic spaces defined by a non-negative continuous matrix weight. As preparation, we prove a Poincaré inequality with respect to such matrix weights and analyze the elementary properties of the weighted spaces. Comparisons to known results and examples of operators which are elliptic away from a hyperplane of arbitrary codimension are given. Finally, in the important special case of operators whose principal part is of Grushin type, we apply these results to obtain some spectral theory results such as the existence of a principal eigenvalue.},

The corresponding class of initial and boundary value problems has already been studied previously, proving well-posedness of weak solutions and the existence of the global attractor, assuming that the nonlinearities are subcritical to a given exponent. The goal of this article is to show that the previous analysis can be redone for supercritical nonlinearities by proving an additional L∞-estimate on the solutions. In particular, we derive new conditions which reflect an exact balance between the internal and the boundary mechanisms involved, even when both the nonlinear sources contribute in opposite directions. Then, we show how to construct a trajectory attractor for the weak solutions of the associated parabolic system, and prove that any solution belonging to the attractor is bounded, which implies uniqueness. Finally, we also prove for the (semilinear) reaction–diffusion equation with nonlinear dynamic boundary conditions, that the fractal dimension of the global attractor is of the order ν−(N−1), as diffusion ν→0+, in any space dimension N⩾2, improving some recent results in Gal (2012) [23].},

By using the compactness of the embeddings of the weighted Sobolev spaces involved in the functional formulation of the problem, and the associated energy equation, we show the existence of a global attractor. The extension of the main result in the case of an unbounded domain is also discussed, where in addition, the diffusion coefficient has to be unbounded. Some remarks for the case of a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation are given.},

We show the existence of a global branch of nonnegative stationary states, covering both the cases of a bounded and an unbounded domain. The global bifurcation of stationary states, implies-in conjuction with the definition of a gradient dynamical system in the natural phase space-that at least in the case of a bounded domain, any solution with nonnegative initial data tends to the trivial or the nonnegative equilibrium. Applications of the global bifurcation result to general degenerate semilinear as well as to quasilinear elliptic equations, are also discussed.},
