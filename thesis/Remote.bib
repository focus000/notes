  abstract = {This book in the BCAM SpringerBriefs series is a treatise on the p-Laplace equation. It is based on lectures by the author that were originally delivered at the Summer School in Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}, Finland, in August 2005 and have since been updated and extended to cover various new topics, including viscosity solutions and asymptotic mean values. The p-Laplace equation is a far-reaching generalization of the ordinary Laplace equation, but it is non-linear and degenerate (p{$>$}2) or singular (p},
